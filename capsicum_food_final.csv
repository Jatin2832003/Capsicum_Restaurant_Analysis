Always come if you have extra time with money as time and money both are expensive nowadays. Keep in kind that order and take away is only option. You have to keep tracking of your token number on the display at the service table. Service is but slow but food was good. I ordered masala dosa and a coke which costs me around 150 bucks. You'll have to wait and watch. After taking your food you're free to enjoy. Go visit this place and give your openion.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Had to wait a good 45 minutes for a plate of chole Bhature. The supervisor too paid no heed to our requests of giving the food faster. The people over there just don’t care about the customers and pay zero attention to them.

Paid ₹110 + taxes for this. Ridiculous indeed.

I would suggest everyone to refrain from going here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Last year I also had few paneer main course items here. The service is slow and place was crowded. The main course items were also average in taste.

The entity/organizatiin claims to be a restaurant. It is not a restaurant. It is a sleeping rehabilitation center.  If you have difficulty in sleeping, look no further, come to this place.  Your order will take 1 1/2 hour (90 minutes). Within this time frame, there is a great possibility that you are going to take 4 to 5 power nap.

Capsicum food court provides a student-friendly, family-friendly, and budget-friendly option to its customers. The menu has so much variety that you can eat there at the beginning of the month when you have enough money to eat something fancy or you could eat there at month end when the  budget is a little tight.

The food there is delicious. Anything you order from their menu will turn out to be delicious. I can say this because I have experimented with their menu and they have satisfied my taste buds everytime.

The quantity of their food is sufficient. you will get your money worth from Capsicum. I will recommend their white sauce pasta to you. It has served at dinner for me and my friends multiple times.
